## Quick start <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->


The Solve3 Captcha Node Module is designed to offer captcha protection for your smart contracts, effectively guarding against bot interference. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you integrate this module into your projects frontend.

### Installation

Begin by installing the `@solve3/captcha` package using npm or yarn. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install @solve3/captcha
# or
yarn add @solve3/captcha
```

<!-- ### Usage -->

Now, let's dive into the implementation:

### Initialization

First, you need to initialize the Solve3 Captcha module by importing it and creating an instance of it. This step should be done at the beginning of your code.

```javascript
import { Solve3 } from "@solve3/captcha";

const solve3 = new Solve3();
```

### Event handling
The Solve3 Captcha module emits a "success" event when the user successfully completes the captcha challenge. You can listen for this event and define what should happen when the event is triggered.

```javascript
solve3.on("success", async (proof) => {
  // This is where you can send the transaction using the proof.
  // Example: sendTransaction(proof);
});
```

### Handshake

   Before sending a transaction, you'll need a message (handshake) to sign. This message typically includes the user's wallet address, the destination contract, and the network ID (chain ID).

   ```javascript
   const messageToSign = await solve3.init({
     account: walletAddress,
     destination: destinationContract,
     network: chainId,
   });
   ```

 ### Sign message

   You need to sign the message with the user's wallet. This can be done using a signing function provided by your Ethereum library (e.g., ethers.js or web3.js). Make sure you have the user's wallet set up and available.

   ```javascript
   const signature = await signMessage(messageToSign);
   ```

 ### Open captcha

   Finally, open the Solve3 Captcha challenge, passing the previously obtained signature. This will display the captcha challenge to the user.

   ```javascript
   await solve3.open(signature);
   ```

## Full Example

**using React.js and wagmi**

This React.js example initializes the Solve3 Captcha module, gets the message to sign, signs the message using wagmi, and opens the captcha challenge when the `Set Message`` button is clicked. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual values and Ethereum provider.

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";
import { useAccount, useSignMessage, useContractWrite } from "wagmi";
import { abi } from "./abi";
import { Solve3 } from "@solve3/captcha";

const Message = () => {
  const yourContract: `0x${string}` = "0xYourContractAddress";

  const { signMessageAsync } = useSignMessage();
  const { address } = useAccount();
  const [message, setMessage] = useState<string>("");

  const { writeAsync } = useContractWrite({
    address: yourContract,
    abi: abi,
    functionName: "setMessage",
  });

  const solve3 = new Solve3();

  solve3.on("success", async (proof: string) => {
    // function sig: setMessage(string memory message, bytes memory proof)
    await writeAsync({ args: [message, proof] });
  });

  const onClickHandler = async () => {
    const messageToSign: string = await solve3.init({
      account: address as string,
      destination: yourContract,
      network: 5,
    });

    const signature = await signMessageAsync({ message: messageToSign });
    await solve3.open(signature);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      ...
      <h3>New Message:</h3>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={message}
        onChange={(e) => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={onClickHandler}>Set Message</button>
      ...
    </div>
  );
};

export default Message;

```
